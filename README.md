# AI-for-instruction-level-sidechannel
Side-channel instruction recovery from power/EM traces. A highly-encapsulated framework unifies classical ML and modern DL (CNN, LSTM, MoE) with GPU-accelerated preprocessing, multi-label classification and neural architecture search for efficient, scalable reverse engineering.
